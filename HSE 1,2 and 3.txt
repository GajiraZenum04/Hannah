Stepping into the role of a Health, Safety, and Environment (HSE) Officer in the tech industry has been an exciting and eye-opening experience. Coming from a background in Medical Laboratory Science, with experience in fashion and caregiving, I initially wondered how my skills would translate into the fast-paced world of technology. However, these past few weeks have shown me that workplace safety is universal, and every industry requires a solid foundation in health and environmental consciousness.

One of the first things I had to adapt to was the corporate structure of the tech industry. Unlike more physically demanding fields, tech workplaces may not seem hazardous at first glance, but I quickly learned that risks still exist. From ergonomic concerns due to prolonged screen time and poor posture to fire safety, electrical hazards, and mental health challenges like burnout, the scope of my role became clearer.
